Regression Models (SLR & MLR) on how Cigarette use, Family Income Levels, & Birth weight influence one another. Data retrieved from the Wooldridge package in the bwght dataset.

## Part 2  - House Price Estimation/Prediction:

Regression model (MLR) on whether an individual paid over or under the estimated/predicted house price based on the size and number of bedrooms. Data retrieved from the Wooldridge package in the bwght dataset.

## Part 3  - Predicting Attendence Rates based on ACT score and GPA:

Regression model (MLR) on predicted attendance rated based on ACT score and GPA. Data retrieved from the Wooldridge package in the bwght dataset.
